# Bitwarden

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) is a free and open-source password management service that stores sensitive information such as website credentials in an encrypted vault. This is a Bitwarden server API implementation written in Rust compatible with [upstream Bitwarden clients](https://bitwarden.com/#download), perfect for self-hosted deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be ideal.

The GIT Repository for Bitwarden is located at [https://github.com/dani-garcia/bitwarden_rs](https://github.com/dani-garcia/bitwarden_rs)

## Bitwarden Install

When installing the Bitwarden container, the installer will install under Appdata directory as the root user, however once it is installed you can change the owner/group of it to whatever is required

Run the below command (from a terminal) to change the permissions if required.

`sudo chown -R owner:group ~/.config/appdata/bitwarden`

Having the owner group change will allow you to edit the files if required without running into permission issues.

## Using MariaDB for your database instead of the self container

Great way to go about this would be installing phpmyadmin and MariaDB from the selected docker apps.

By default, MariaDB and PhpMyAdmin is already linked together. So go ahead and open your PhpMyAdmin portal

Once on the PhPMyAdmin Portal. Create a new database and user for your bitwarden account.

If that's seems too long, I find it easy to create users and databases is to run ``` docker exec ``` command

On your DockStarter terminal; type in the command below to connect to your container. Once there, use ``` mysql ``` command and database username and password. 

```bash
DockStarter@192.168.2.1:~$ docker exec -it mariadb bash
```

```bash
# if you didnt set a root password inside your enviorment file, then just hit return.
root@192.168.1.1:/# mysql --user=root --password="somepassword"
```
If you see the message below, continue on and create your bitwarden database and user

```sql

VERIFY and Database

```
Finally create an Override file: 

```yaml
version: "3.4"  # this must match the version in docker-compose.yml
services:
  bitwarden:
    environment:
    - DATABASE_URL=mysql://BITWARDEN_USER:BITWARDEN_PASSWORD@mariadb/BITWARDEN_DB # Remember to replace with your own configuration
    - ENABLE_DB_WAL=false
    image: bitwardenrs/server-mysql
```

Save and run ``` ds -c ```
